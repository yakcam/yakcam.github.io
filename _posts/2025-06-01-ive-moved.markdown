My blog has moved, from wordpress to GitHub Pages and Jekyll.

Over the course of the year I'll endeavour to go through my old posts and fix any issues that came out of the conversion.

The conversion itself was fairly painless, following [this guide](https://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/wordpressdotcom/){:target="_blank"}.
