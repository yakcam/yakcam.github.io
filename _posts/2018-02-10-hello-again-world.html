<p>I signed up for this blog about 12 years ago and for the life of me, I can't remember what motivated me to give it a go at the time. All I remember is that I was full of enthusiasm for the exciting journey ahead.</p>
<p>The second time around, I'm not entirely sure what has brought me back here. I know that I have a much greater appreciation of just how much effort will be required to make this a much more regular thing. Sitting down at a keyboard and actually <em>writing</em> is not my idea of fun, though barely two paragraphs in and I'm finding some kind of inner voice and relaxing into it a little.</p>
<p>I'm 'Lead Product Developer' in a team of approximately 22 and loving it; I get to solve all sorts of weird and wonderful problems and love to learn.</p>
<p>I have no real idea of what the topics on this blog will be, likely a mixture of my life and my work.</p>
<p>Only 166 words; must try harder.</p>
