I'm an experienced software engineer who has worked their way up from an internship, taking in support desk, team leadership/management and senior leadership team roles along the way.

I've gone back to being an IC, working at [Wagestream](https://wagestream.com){:target="_blank"}, a London based fintech whose mission is to provide fair financial services to frontline workers.
